# DexDiffuser: Generating Dexterous Grasps with Diffusion Models 

This repository contains the PyTorch implementation of DexDiffuser. 

We introduce DexDiffuser, a novel dexterous grasping method that generates, evaluates, and refines grasps on partial object point clouds. DexDiffuser includes the conditional diffusion-based grasp sampler DexSampler and the dexterous grasp evaluator DexEvaluator. DexSampler generates high quality grasps conditioned on object point clouds by iterative denoising of randomly sampled grasps.

[Training data](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pAfkVYeYUWfKs8TEAoppScO3IoHcYQML?usp=sharing)

## Train

Modify the path in config paths so that the model can find the data

Train the sampler
```
bash scprits/train_sampler.sh
```

Train the evalutaor
```
bash scripts/train_evaluator.sh
```

## Grasp Generation & Refinement & Test

generate grasps (set guid_scale to use EGD)
```
bash scripts/sample.sh
```

refine the generated grasps
```
bash scripts/refine.sh
```

(optional) test grasps in isaacgym
```
python isaac_test_right.py --eval_dir path_to_grasps
```
